# Python Variable-Based Problem-Solving Questions (Basic to Advanced)
# 1. Simple Interest: SI = (P * R * T) / 100
p = int(input("Enter Principle Amount: "))
r = 10
t = 365
SI = (p * r * t)/100
print("Answer 1:" ,SI)
# 2. Area of Rectangle: A = length * breadth
l = int(input("Enter Length in cm: "))
b = int(input("Enter Breadth in cm: "))
area = l*b
print("Answer 2: Area of rectangle: " ,area)
# 3. Perimeter of Rectangle: 2 * (length + breadth)
l = int(input("Enter Length in cm: "))
b = int(input("Enter Breadth in cm: "))
perimeter = 2*(l+b)
print("Answer 2: Perimeter of rectangle: " ,perimeter)
# 4. Swap Two Variables using a third variable
v1 = "v1"
v2 = "v2"
temp = v1
v1 = v2
v2 = temp
print("Answer 4:" ,v1 ,v2)
# 5. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
# 6. Calculate Square and Cube of a Number
num = int(input("Enter number: "))
